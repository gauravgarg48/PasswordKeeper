Hi Sir,
REQUEST: I know intermediate python but I don't have any knowledge of django or any web framework but I have done intermediate android development. The work that I have uploaded is just my 2 hours of learning of web development - django and HTML. I'm very hard working and fast learning candidate. Kindly please consider this before announcing your decision. I really want to get hired in WORKINDIA so that I can learn all the required skills and implement them. Thank You.

I have implemented the login screen and the registration screen which are working fine and redirect the user to homepage but due to lack of time I couldn't completed that.
